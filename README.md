# Blocket Sniper

Blocket Sniper is a Google Chrome extension made to constantly refresh the watched ads page of the Swedish second-hand online store "Blocket".
The constant refresh is watched with a script that notifies audibly if a new ad is listed.
This is meant to gain an advantage over those using the official app to get notified, as the app is far slower than an instant page reload.

To be used at ['Sparade Bevakningar'](https://www.blocket.se/sparade/bevakningar).
